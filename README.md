## For Developers: Build Process

This plugin uses a modern JavaScript stack (React and Vite) for its admin interface. The source code is located in the `/src` directory.

To work with the source code, you'll need Node.js and npm installed.

    ```

3.  **Run the build process:**
    *   For development (with hot-reloading): `npm run dev`
    *   For production (minified assets): `npm run build`

The compiled production assets are generated in the `/build` directory, which is the code distributed in the WordPress plugin.
